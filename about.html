        <h1 class="section-title">Two friends on a very unserious mission</h1>
        <p>
          We are two friends with a life mission to explore the unbeaten paths of the world, hunting
          for the best gems, restaurants, people and places to experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ben’s fucking fault” started as the line we used whenever a monument was under
          construction, a road turned into a dirt track, or a booking went sideways. Eventually we
          stopped fighting it and built a travel project around it.

          <h2 class="card-title">Not Best Friends Forever</h2>
          <p class="card-body">
            It’s BFF because Ben booked two ATVs instead of four, led us down roads we had no
            business being on, and once put us in a desert camp where we are pretty sure the soup
            was… suspect. When things go sideways, it is Ben’s Fucking Fault.

          <h2 class="card-title">The meticulous chaos engine</h2>
          <p class="card-body">
            Ben is the researcher. Weeks of planning, deep dives into local blogs, obscure forums
            and maps to find cool, undiscovered attractions and cultural weirdness. The trip looks
            chaotic, but under the hood it is painfully well prepared.

          <h2 class="card-title">The wild card</h2>
          <p class="card-body">
            Daniel is the chaos magnet. Trouble finds him and we just roll with it. He sniffs out
            bars that sell more than just alcohol, navigates the seedier parts of town, negotiates
            with taxi drivers and bus operators, rents the bikes and makes the “is this a bad
            idea?” choices that somehow turn out right.

          <p class="card-body">
            Individually we have visited more than 60 countries, but the trips that inspired BFF
            together have taken us to Turkey (twice), Jordan, Morocco, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam,
            Malaysia, Slovakia, Hungary, Sweden, Luxembourg and Portugal — with many more to come.

            You tell us where you want to go, what kind of energy you are after and your budget. We
            design a custom itinerary full of hidden spots, questionable decisions and unforgettable
            stories. And if it all goes to shit, well… it is BFF and you can blame Ben.
